# Smart_Bottle_LMS_v1
Script-In-Progress to connect smart bottle to Lord Micro Strain wireless base station &amp; provide on the fly control &amp; data analysis

If you want to start using the script it can be adapted with any Lord Wireless communication board, to do so ensure you have placed the lcms.py file in either the same directory or assign it a path to your system as it is the library that has bindings to C# to make the code function possible.
